# the-united-individual

A bilingual (Chinese / English) exploratory site.

This project presents:
- a minimal set of shared principles (Basic Spirit),
- the structural challenges individuals face today,
- and a gradual, voluntary path toward deeper exploration.

This repository contains the MVP version of the site.
